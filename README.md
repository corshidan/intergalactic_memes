# Hackathon Week 7

For todays hackathon we will be creating a web experience using data from an api - in your pairs! Use all the tools youâ€™ve learned, and you will better understand how to overcome some problems before the project next week.

## Task 1 - Api Research (20 - 30 mins)

Research what apis are available. You can use [this](https://apilist.fun) to help, but also go and explore. You can always fall back on pokemon/starwars/quiz/dad-jokes if needs be.

## Task 2 - Ideate and Plan (30 - 60 mins)

Use disney ideation to come up with an idea of what you want to build in the day. Then decide what your MVP is, and make it so that you can achieve your MVP before lunch. Break down your idea into its component parts. And prioritise your tasks.

## Task 3 - Build your MVP (60 - 180 mins)

Build your MVP. Have the most simple essence of your app working before lunch. Make regular commits as you build each component. Consider using React Router, UseReducer, UseEffect, etc.. if appropriate.

## Task 4 - Deployment
Deploy your MVP on netlify as soon as possible. Each time you push a new version of your app to Github, netlify should automatically rebuild and deploy it. If your app uses environment variables, be sure to configure these on Netlify. (Look at the docs for more info)

## Task 5 - Stretch Goals

Have a quick chat about what you are going to build next. Break it down into tasks that you can work on and build it!

## Show & Tell @ 16:00
Each person in your pair should have a speaking role and aim for your app demo to be no longer than 4 minutes. You should use the deployed version to demonstrate your app. Feel free to post a link in the chat for others to see while presenting.
